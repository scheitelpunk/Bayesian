## Key Architectural Decisions

### System Design Patterns

#### 1. Layered Architecture
```
Application Layer (Training, Inference, API)
          ↓
Core Model Layer (Bayesian Components)
          ↓
Data Layer (Loading, Preprocessing)
          ↓
Infrastructure Layer (Checkpointing, Logging)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test layers independently
- Flexible component replacement
- Maintainable codebase

#### 2. Model Checkpointing
**Pattern:** Hierarchical with three checkpoint types

**Training Checkpoints:**
- Frequency: Every epoch
- Retention: Keep last 3
- Purpose: Resume training

**Milestone Checkpoints:**
- Frequency: Validation improvement
- Retention: Indefinite
- Purpose: Experiment tracking

**Production Checkpoints:**
- Frequency: Manual export
- Retention: Versioned
- Purpose: Deployment

#### 3. Data Pipeline
**Pattern:** HuggingFace Datasets + PyTorch DataLoader

**Stages:**
1. Load IMDB dataset (HuggingFace)
2. Tokenize with caching (parallel)
3. Format for PyTorch (tensors)
4. DataLoader with prefetching

**Optimizations:**
- Disk caching (no re-tokenization)
- Parallel processing (num_workers=4)
- Prefetching (overlap I/O and compute)
- Pin memory (faster GPU transfer)

#### 4. API Design
**Pattern:** FastAPI + Pydantic validation

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /predict` - Single prediction with uncertainty
- `POST /batch-predict` - Batch inference
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics
- `GET /model-info` - Model metadata

**Features:**
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Type-safe validation
- Async request handling
- Error handling with proper HTTP codes

#### 5. Monitoring Architecture
**Pattern:** Multi-backend metrics collection

**Backends:**
- TensorBoard (real-time training viz)
- Weights & Biases (experiment tracking)
- Prometheus (system metrics)
- JSON logs (structured logging)

**Metrics Categories:**
- Training (loss, accuracy, learning rate)
- Model (CoT length, uncertainty, violations)
- System (GPU util, memory, throughput)
- Performance (latency, error rate)

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Located in [`../adrs/`](../adrs/):

#### [ADR-001: PyTorch over TensorFlow](../adrs/ADR-001-pytorch-over-tensorflow.md)
**Decision:** Use PyTorch as the deep learning framework
**Rationale:**
- Research-first approach (dynamic graphs)
- Better custom layer implementation
- Seamless HuggingFace integration
- Strong academic adoption

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Faster development velocity
- ✅ Easier debugging (imperative style)
- ⚠️ Less mature production tooling (mitigated with TorchServe/ONNX)

#### [ADR-002: FastAPI for REST API](../adrs/ADR-002-fastapi-for-rest-api.md)
**Decision:** Use FastAPI for model serving API
**Rationale:**
- High-performance async/await support
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Type-safe request/response (Pydantic)
- Excellent developer experience

**Performance:**
- 2,400 RPS vs 1,500 RPS (Flask)
- p95 latency: 180ms vs 320ms (Flask)

#### [ADR-004: Model Checkpointing Strategy](../adrs/ADR-004-model-checkpointing-strategy.md)
**Decision:** Hierarchical checkpointing with three checkpoint types
**Checkpoint Types:**
1. **Training Checkpoints:** Frequent, rolling retention (last 3)
2. **Milestone Checkpoints:** On validation improvement, indefinite retention
3. **Production Checkpoints:** Manual export, versioned

**Benefits:**
- Optimizes storage vs recovery tradeoff
- Supports multiple use cases
- Atomic writes (no corruption)
- Full reproducibility

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Core Model Layer:** Bayesian transformer components
- **Data Layer:** Dataset loading and preprocessing
- **Application Layer:** Training orchestration and inference serving
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Checkpointing, logging, metrics

### 2. Modularity
- Each component has clear responsibilities
- Well-defined interfaces between components
- Easy to test in isolation
- Easy to replace/upgrade individual components

### 3. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling (stateless API)
- Vertical scaling (GPU optimization)
- Distributed training support (DDP)
- Efficient caching strategies

### 4. Reliability
- Fault tolerance (checkpointing)
- Error handling and recovery
- Health checks and monitoring
- Graceful degradation

### 5. Maintainability
- Clear documentation
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive testing
- Configuration management

### 6. Performance
- Async API (high concurrency)
- GPU optimization (mixed precision)
- Efficient data loading (prefetching)
- Model optimization (quantization, pruning)

## Quick Start

### Understanding the Architecture

**Start with:**
1. Read [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Executive Summary
2. Review C4 diagrams (System Context → Container → Component)
3. Study [Component Diagrams](COMPONENT_DIAGRAMS.md) for detailed flows
4. Read relevant ADRs for decision context

**For specific concerns:**
- **Model Implementation:** Section 3.1 in System Architecture
- **Training Pipeline:** Section 3.2 + Training Workflow Diagram
- **API Design:** Section 3.6 + Inference API Flow
- **Checkpointing:** ADR-004 + Checkpoint Flow Diagram
- **Data Processing:** Section 3.4 + Data Pipeline Flow
- **Deployment:** Section 5 (Deployment Architecture)

### Implementation Order

Based on the architecture, recommended implementation sequence:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
1. Set up directory structure
2. Implement core model components
3. Create basic unit tests

**Phase 2: Training Pipeline (Week 2)**
1. Implement data loading pipeline
2. Set up checkpointing system
3. Add monitoring and logging

**Phase 3: Inference (Week 3)**
1. Implement FastAPI endpoints
2. Add request validation
3. Create inference optimization

**Phase 4: Production (Week 4)**
1. Deployment configuration
2. CI/CD setup
3. Documentation and examples
